Chosing the right person to take care of you or your loved ones is a pivotal decission that requires a great deal of trust. Care Network aims to connect patients in need of care and care professionals by enabling trust through community peer-review. 

The need of communicating the health status of the patient is also a critical part of a patients journey, especially if the patient is not self-sufficient, leaving this burden usually with the guardian and aggravating an already stresfull situation. Information sharing is central to Care Network, enabling users to decide which information they need and whom they will share it with. These insights can be shared with the medical staff to increase quality of care.
